/**
 * Resolves the full name of the repository as given by Git clients to actual {@link Repository}.
 *
 * <p>
 * This extension point allows multiple plugins to expose their Git repositories via SSH/Git protocol.
 *
 * <h2>Repository Name</h2>
 * <p>
 * Both methods of this interface uses the parameter 'fullRepositoryName'.
 *
 * <p>
 * This parameter represents the repository path name as given by git client.
 * For example, "foo/bar.git" for client running "git push jenkins:foo/bar.git"
 * and "/foo/bar.git" for client running "git push ssh://jenkins/foo/bar.git".
 *
 * <p>
 * To avoid conflicts, plugins are highly encouraged to require a known prefix.
 * For example, if you are implementing acme-plugin, you should only recognize
 * "acme/foo.git" or "acme/foo/bar.git" but not "foo.git"
 *
 * <p>
 * Similarly, because of the difference in the way the leading '/' appears based on the protocol,
 * most implementations should support both "/acme/foo.git" and "acme/foo.git".
